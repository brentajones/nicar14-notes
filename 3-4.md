####Notes

NPR App Template

They use it for everything

It's customizeable

The guts:

* Flask app
* Fabric
* Jinja2
* Amazon S3
* Bootstrap

Starting a project:

* Clone the repo
* mkvirtualenv
* pip install requirements
* bootstrap (create files, push to remotes)
* create default GitHub issues & labels

Default app template has examples

Copy is handled through spreadsheets

**Fab update copy** command updates the copy

It's displayed through JINJA templates

One-touch deployment

* LESS and JST compiled
* Jinja baked to flat HTML
* CSS and JS minified and compressed into one file
* Everything gzipped
* pushed to S3

How to defeat caching? Timestamped files.

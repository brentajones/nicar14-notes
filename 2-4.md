####Notes

45k lines of javascript; 12k lines of python

How to support huge amounts of data with very small hardware requirements?

Solution: Search, not database.

#####Data Stack:

* PostgreSQL
* Solr

#####Web Stack

* Nginx
* usWGI
* python

Relational DB uses documents as objects, and documents have terms.

Inverted index uses terms as objects, and each has documents.

Solr thinks all the data is text, so it's very fast.

#####Ranking results

TF/IDF ranking (like google uses) is not what you want when searching structured data.

Can search on columns with dynamic columns.

Common name matching for aliases.

Some relational data: Metadata

How do you process >100MB uploads while maintaining a real-time UI? Asynchronous processing with celery.

How do you provide access for both people and machines? Program API first.

Even the GUI goes through the API using tastypie. It's an all JS client using Backbone.js â€” the least worst way.

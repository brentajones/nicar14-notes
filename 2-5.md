##Detecting what isn't there

####Speaker:

Sisi Wei

####Notes
How do you know if you're being censored?

ProPublica did a series on "ghosting". Ghosting is the removal of data while keeping the user in the dark that it's been removed.

1. Collect everything. You can't know it disappeared if you didn't know it was there in the first place.

2. Deleted vs. censored. In ProPublica's case, there was a different error message when trying to access it.

<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>

<p>Census microdata from <a href="https://www.ipums.org/">IPUMS</a> gives you the full range of responses, some custom tables but there&#8217;s also some data supression.</p>

<p>IPUMS is the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s standardized across years. Has documentation. And includes the American Community Survey from 2000-2012.</p>

<p>Example: How many Italian barbers are there?</p>

<p>You can find a total for the country. Then you can narrow it down to a particular state and gender.</p>

<p>But check out the confidence interval and raw numbers.</p>

<p>Another example: How many people might be affected by the ACA/Medicaid Gap in states that aren&#8217;t expanding it.</p>

<p>Problem: Had to translate the census poverty levels to the Medicaid poverty levels. Also had to exclude unauthorized immigrants (might be included in census, but wouldn&#8217;t be covered by Medicaid even if expanded).</p>

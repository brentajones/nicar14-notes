####Notes

Check out [Mother Jones' GitHub news quiz](https://github.com/motherjones/newsquiz)

[Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) turns Google Spreadsheets into structured HTML.

#####What can static sites do for you?

Boston.com elections: One awesome dude's laptop.

Cheaper: Chicago Tribune's 2012 election traffic cost (you know, the one where the president was from Chicago?) was ~$20.

Fast: How quickly do you need data online? Live link to the data, iframe a google spreadsheet, use [Tarbell](http://tarbell.tribapps.com/).

Non-techies in the newsroom can have control.

#####Static sites are bad for:

* Lots of feedback or input from users.
* Geospatial queries.
* Thousands of rows.

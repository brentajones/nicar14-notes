#####Census commuting data ([link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/283mpw3jrxooyql/census-commuting-tipsheet.pdf))

* Choose a topic (census subject definitions file, ACS subjects page link, American FactFinder search)
* Choose a geography (place, county, ZIP code, etc.)
* Choose an ACS dataset 1-, 3-, 5-year periods (1 year is more current but less precise)

Hazards:

* Check out the subject definitions file. It might not mean what you think it means.
* Check out the universe. It might not be counting who you think it's counting.

####Notes

**Snowfall-free zone**

What we're talking about is user-centric design.

#####Design process

1. Define — write a headline for the project *and display it*.
2. Brainstorm — no idea is bad
3. Wireframe/prototype — sanity check
4. Refine and perfect — start small and work up, not the other way around
5. Deliver

####Notes

Initial reporter's tool? Typewriter. Not collaborative. I produce, then send.

It's the same with email.

Open does not equal public. Open means open collaboration.

There's a continuum of stakeholders (not just developers), and all can/should be involved in creating the thing.

Follow the presentation. It's awesome.

####Notes

**Stop doing stuff by hand. Automate it.**

Create a pipeline from start to finish.

Hack-novelist -> hack-analyst -> hack-developer

Brian Boyer's map script (on GitHub)

**use version control**

Can't automate all of it? Automate as much as possible and add the human part as a piece of the pipeline.

Can't automate **decisions**, can automate **processes**.

Use the power of email: update yourself on automated processes.

Django for data entry.

How to get editors to edit data? Scare them with it.

How to save the process? Open refine saves steps.

Project Manager vs. Editor vs. Programmer are three different hats.

**Always** work on a copy.

Fabric python app.

Keep your data all in one place.

Unit test when you are making a novel assertion.

Review process: **You** are responsible for the code you write.
